# cpe203_world
Much of the files for this virual world were provided to us for our OOP course. However,
the classes were all in one function file and we had to refactor the code accordingly,
so all of the classes were written and created by me. We had to add our own functionality to the code as
well, such as a better pathing strategy for the entities to follow. I implemented the A star algorithm
for efficiency. This project taught me a lot about classes and how they work together, as well
as using lambda expressions and comparators in Java.
