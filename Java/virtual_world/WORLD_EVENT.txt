Nicholas Baggett Project 5

1. The event is triggered where the user clicks in the virual world. 

2. When the event is triggered, an ice fortress will spawn surrounded by ice walls. 
There will be four snowmen who will spawn along with two ice soldiers.

3. The snowmen will seek out the nearest miners and combine themselves with the miners to create a Frozen Miner. The Frozen 
Miners are unable to move and they change in appearance.

4. The new entities are the snowmen and the ice soldiers. Snowmen behave as explained above and they also leave an icy background image 
wherever they walk. The ice soldiers will seek out and collect the frozen miners and return them to the ice fortress. The ice fortress also creates 
more snowmen periodically.

5. This project was mine alone, no partners.
